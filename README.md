# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. This is part of the assignments I had to complete as a Lighthouse student.

To build it, I have mostly used HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for the fron end. As far as the backend is concerned, I used Node, Express and MongoDB.

## Directories
Feel free to navigate through all folders in the repository. They have been organised by purpose: 'public' for the front end, and 'server' for the back end.

## Dependencies
- Body-parser
- Chance
- Express
- md5
- MongoDb
- Node 5.10.x or above
